# Project Standards & Workflow

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (Use `bun` for all package management and script execution)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Auth**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5)
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK
- **Bun Style Imports**: Prefer Bun-style APIs and avoid importing `node:*` modules unless there is no viable Bun-compatible alternative.

## Coding Standards

- **Linter/Formatter**: Biome
  - STRICTLY follow Biome rules.
  - **NO non-null assertions** (`!`). Use optional chaining (`?.`) or explicit null checks.
  - **NO `any` type**: Define proper interfaces or types.
  - **Accessibility**:
    - Always associate `<label>` with inputs using `htmlFor` + `id` or nesting.
    - Always specify `type` for `<button>` (button, submit, reset).
  - **Auto-Format**: After modifying files, run `bun biome format --write <file_path>` to ensure code style consistency.
  - Run `bun check` to verify before finishing tasks. If issues persist and cannot be resolved, report them to the user.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Do NOT use `dotenv`. Bun automatically loads `.env` files.
  - Access via `process.env.VAR_NAME`.
  - ALWAYS check for existence/undefined before using critical env vars.

## Interaction Protocol

### Language Policy

- **Project Language**: This is a Chinese project. UI copy, documentation, and default user-facing text should be written in Chinese unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- **Assistant Reply Language**: All assistant responses must be in Chinese.

### User Intervention

- **Automate Everything**: Do NOT ask the user to run commands unless absolutely necessary (e.g., OAuth flows, third-party account creation).
- **Consent First**: If an action has side effects (e.g., database migration, file deletion), ask for consent first, then execute immediately upon approval.
- **Retry Limit**: If an action (e.g., linter fix, test run) fails or produces the same error 3 times in a row, STOP and ask the user for guidance. Do NOT loop indefinitely.
- **Planning Change Sync**: If a request changes product planning or feature strategy, update both implementation code and `README.md` in the same task.

### Browser Debugging & MCP Usage

- **Primary Browser MCP**: For frontend inspection, debugging, and verification, ALWAYS use `user-chrome-devtools` MCP first.
- **Required Checks**: When validating a page, use DevTools MCP to inspect:
  - page snapshot (`take_snapshot`)
  - console logs (`list_console_messages`)
  - network requests when relevant (`list_network_requests`)
- **Tool Preference**: Do NOT use other browser MCP servers for normal page verification unless the user explicitly requests it.

### Model Routing

- **Task-to-Model Mapping**:
  - Use **GPT** for code writing, code fixes, refactoring, debugging, and test-related implementation tasks.
  - Use **Gemini** for documentation writing, task planning, requirement decomposition, and roadmap-style outputs.
- **Pre-Execution Model Check**:
  - Before starting any task, verify the currently selected model matches the task type above.
  - If the model does not match, STOP and ask the user whether to switch model before proceeding.

### Response Format

Every response must follow this structure exactly:

1. **变更摘要 (Summary)**
   - Brief explanation of the "Why" behind changes or current status.
2. **我完成了什么 (Completed Actions)**
   - Concise list of completed actions (file creations, edits, deletions).
3. **验证结果 (Verification)**
   - Confirm linter checks (`bun check`), type safety, or manual tests performed.
4. **目前有什么问题 (Current Issues)**
   - List of known bugs, blockers, or unresolved issues. If none, state "None".
5. **你需要我同意什么 (Pending Approval)**
   - List of sensitive actions waiting for user approval (e.g., DB migrations, destructive deletions). If none, state "None".
6. **需要我做什么 (User Action)**
   - List of manual actions the user must perform (e.g., "Add API Key to .env").
7. **下一步计划 (Next Steps)**
   - (Optional) If the task is incomplete, what is the immediate next step.

## Database Workflow

- **Schema Changes**: Modify `lib/db/schema.ts`.
- **Migration**: Use `bun db:push` for rapid prototyping.
- **Vector Search**: Ensure `pgvector` extension is enabled (handled via Docker).

## Docker

- Use `docker-compose` for local database services.
- Database credentials must match `.env.local`.
